### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/iamvanshverma/gfest.git](https://github.com/iamvanshverma/gfest.git) # (Unified/DataBuddy Repo used as main clone)
    cd gfest
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set up the API Keys:**
    * Get your API key from [Google AI Studio]() and SendGrid.
    * Set them as environment variables (recommended):
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        export SENDGRID_API_KEY="YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY_HERE" 
        ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py # (Or your primary Streamlit file name)
    ```

## üîí Privacy & Security Assurance

This application is built with user privacy as a critical priority:

* **Stateless Processing:** Data is only read, processed, and immediately discarded after the analysis or report generation is complete. **Your data is never persisted on DaB.AI servers.**
* **Read-Only Scope:** The application only requests permission to **read** the data from the Google Sheet you specify. It cannot modify or delete your files, ensuring your source data remains untouched.
