## 🛠️ Combined Technology Stack & Setup

The entire DaB.AI Platform is built on the following robust and scalable technologies:

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Engine** | **Google Gemini API** | Powers all complex reasoning, natural language understanding, and sophisticated data analysis across both modules. |
| **Frontend/UI** | **Streamlit** | Provides the responsive, interactive, and beautifully designed user interface for both apps. |
| **Data Handling** | **Python, Pandas, NumPy** | Core language and libraries for efficient data manipulation and mathematics. |
| **Visualization** | **Matplotlib, Plotly** | Core libraries used for generating static and interactive charts and dashboards. |
| **Integrations** | **Google Sheets API** (OAuth 2.0), **SendGrid** | Secure data access and professional email distribution for ReportPilot. |
| **Hosting/Infra** | **Render** | Deployment environment for the Streamlit app and handling automated job scheduling for ReportPilot. |

### Installation

1.  **Clone the main repository** (which contains both submodules):
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Main Repository Link Here] 
    cd DaB.AI-IntelligencePlatform
    ```
2.  **Initialize and update submodules** (for DataBuddy AI and ReportPilot repos):
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** (assuming a consolidated `requirements.txt`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up the API Keys:**
    * Get your API key from [Google AI Studio]() and SendGrid.
    * Set them as environment variables (recommended for security):
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        export SENDGRID_API_KEY="YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY_HERE" 
        ```
5.  **Run the application:** (Assuming there is a main entry point file)
    ```bash
    streamlit run main_app.py # (Use the appropriate command for your consolidated app)
    ```

## 🚀 Getting Started (Combined User Flow)

The application is designed for an intuitive, smooth user experience across both modules:

### A. DataBuddy AI Workflow (Interactive Analysis)

1.  **Upload:** Navigate to the **Settings & Upload** sidebar and upload your `.csv` file. *(Supported: CSV format, up to 200MB, UTF-8 Recommended)*.
2.  **Analyze (AI Chat Tab):** Use the **Quick Analysis** buttons (e.g., *Overall Summary*) or type your question, then click **Analyze**. Review the detailed Analysis Results.
3.  **Visualize:** Use the **Interactive Visualizations** builder to create custom charts.
4.  **Report:** Click **Generate Full Report** to automate the final output.

### B. ReportPilot Workflow (Automated Reporting)

1.  **Authorization:** Navigate to the ReportPilot tab and click **"Authorize Google Sheets"** to begin the OAuth flow.
2.  **Data Load:** Paste your Google Sheet URL.
3.  **Generate Report:** Click **`Generate AI Analysis`** (for text insights) and **`Generate Charts`** (for visuals).
4.  **Setup Automation:** Switch to the **Schedule Reports** tab. Set the recipient, frequency, and desired **Report Language**. Click **`Schedule Report`**.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Assurance

This application is designed with user privacy as a critical priority:

* **Stateless Processing:** Data is only read when an action is triggered (analysis or scheduling). It is immediately discarded afterward. **Your data is never persisted on DaB.AI servers.**
* **Read-Only Scope:** The application only requests permission to **read** the data from the Google Sheet you specify. It cannot modify or delete your files.
